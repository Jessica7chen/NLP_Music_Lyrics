I say we use this text file as a basic outline to start.
They have a tab named "Projects" we can use to create a more aesthetically pleasing outline with bins "To do", "In Progress", and "Done".

Once I commit this file to Tyra's repository it becomes public for any collaborators, our group, to edit.
I believe it keeps a history of the changes to the files we upload, and you can comment what you've changed to the file when you commit it.
I say we play around with this text file as a way to test how this system works. It seems very similar to Google Drive.
