# Song Lyric Decade Project

# initialize environment: load libraries and data (can be done retroactively)
#   choose NLP language to work with
#   create sample dataset - train/test data

# clean data: remove punctuation, remove stop words
#   lemmatize (found->find), stem (playing->play)
#   tokenize ("Down the street the dogs are barking"->"Down","street","dog","bark")
#   create variable "decade"
#     will it be more accurate predicting year then figuring decade, or predicting decade?

# build term document matrix (research model)
